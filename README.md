# Barber Shop Website
This Web application is in its starting phase. As of now I have finished completing the web design portion of the website, creating a simple yet cool looking user interface that is fully responsive to almost all screen sizes. I plan to make this a fully functional web application that allows users to book appointments at their local barbersop. The main purpose of this web solution would be to help barbershop owners not only promte thier buiness by offering a users the ability to have easy access to the buinesses social media handles, but also automate thier customer appointments to speed up the work-flow.

# Future plans for this project
For now the plan is deliever a finished product that can actually be used in real-life. I plan to finish implementing the logic for booking appointments and adding a whole user interface for viewing, deleting and editng appointments. However, that is not where I want to end it. I have some ideas for making this into something much bigger. Even so, I am still unsure of which direction to take it and only time will tell where this can go.
