# Barber Shop Website
This Web application is in its starting phase. As of now I have finished completing the web design portion of the website, creating a simple yet cool looking user interface that is fully responsive to almost all screen sizes. I plan to make this a fully functional web application that allows users to book appointments at their local barbershop.

# Front-End Languages
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

# What can this Web Application do?
As I said, this web app is still in it's infancy. For now this solution is just a static website with the only real funtionality being used to:
- promote a barbershop 
- showing thier services
- links to their social handles 
- Displaying contact information 
- Showing location as well as the directions to the location using the Google Maps API.

# Future plans for this project
For now the plan is deliever a finished product that can actually be used in real-life. I plan to finish implementing the logic for booking appointments and adding a whole user interface for viewing, deleting and editng appointments. However, that is not where I want to end it. I have some ideas for making this into something much bigger. Even so, I am still unsure of which direction to take it and only time will tell where this can go.
