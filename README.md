# Barber Shop Website
This Web application is in its starting phase. As of now I have finished completing the web design portion of the website, creating a simple yet cool looking user interface that is fully responsive to almost all screen sizes. I plan to make this a fully functional web application that allows users to book appointments at their local barbersop. The main purpose of this web solution would be to help barbershop owners not only promte thier buiness by offering a users the ability to have easy access to the buinesses social media handles, but also automate thier customer appointments to speed up the work-flow.
